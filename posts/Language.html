           <p class="paragraph">A pretty recent hobby as of late that I have picked up is language learning. I am currently working on the languages Chinese and Korean. The "working on Chinese" part can seem quite odd as it is my native language. But after all, can anyone really understand everything about their language?</p>
           <br>
           <p class="paragraph">Even as I learned a language like Korean, by all accounts a pretty distinct language when compared to Chinese, I have found that the hardest part of language is not the grammar or the vocabulary. The hardest part of learning a language is actually the pain of studying hundreds of hours just to understand a few more sentences and phrases. The fear of looking like a goof and embarassing yourself is apparently an integral part of language learning.</p>
           <br>
           <p class="paragraph">3 months later, I'd say my language skills with Korean can barely be considered intermediate, which is an improvement. (I guess?). Although it is a little frustrating, It has taught me a lot of lessons. Mainly, that the people who know an absurd amount of languages are not actually next level geniuses but shameless goofs who don't mind being corrected for mistakes.</p>
           <br>
           <p class="paragraph">Maybe one day, my Chinese or Korean will catch up to my English ability, but I guess I'm stuck with this "coloniser" language for now.</p>
